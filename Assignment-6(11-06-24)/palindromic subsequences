 Count Palindromic Subsequences
 Given a string of digits s, return the number of palindromic subsequences of s having length 5.
 Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
 Note:
 ● Astring is palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward.
● Asubsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no
 characters without changing the order of the remaining characters
